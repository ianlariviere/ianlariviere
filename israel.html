<h1> Israel Trip 2015 </h1>
</body>
  <P>
    In 2015, with a school group, I had the opportunity to go to Israel. It was organized by a company that regularly goes there, so the dangers of the area were minimized. My generation has grown up with the Middle East front and center in the news. I've also grown up familiar with the places and names in the Bible, as a weekly Sunday School attendee. To visit an area with such rich cultural history and ongoing political strife gave me much to ponder. From a hilltop near the border of Syria, I could hear bombs and artillery shells exploding.
