<h1> Mote Man </h1>
<IMG SRC= "Moat Man.jpg" width=400>
  <P> Our family has a cat named Mote Man. Weird name, right? It started out as Otis, we soon noticed he has an M on his forehead, so it became Motis, Mote, then Mote Man. Although I'm really more of a dog person, this cat couldn't be any more precious to me. Like a dog, he likes to eat just about whatever you give him. He goes for walks with us, and generally comes when he's called. There's a funny saying that dogs have owners, but cats have staff. Fittingly, Mote Man has a chair at our dinner table every night, and loves to be hand fed. We know it's ridiculous but we love him too much to care, and anyone who meets him understands why.
