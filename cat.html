<h1> Moat Man </h1>
<IMG SRC= "Moat Man.jpg" width=400>
  <P> Although I'm really more of a dog person, my cat Moat Man couldn't be any more precious to me. Like a dog, he likes to eat just about whatever you give him. He goes for walks with us, and generally comes when he's called. He has a chair at our dinner table every night, and loves to be hand fed.
