  <P> After high school, I worked at my family's small business- a boat yard in Downeast Maine. We haul, launch, maintain, and store boats. We also set docks and moorings. Over the year, I learned and practiced a wide variety of skills. 
  <ul> Sanding, varnishing, painting, polishing, waxing. Operating the fork truck, tractor, and using the hydraulic trailer to pick up and move boats. Maneuvering boats in the water for delivery. Using a bosun's chair to make repairs to masts. Splicing rope Stepping masts and rigging sails Docking boats Communicating effectively with customers
