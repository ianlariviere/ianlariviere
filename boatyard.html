 <IMG SRC= "sanding.jpg" width=400>

  <P> After high school, I worked at my family's small business- a boat yard in Downeast Maine. We haul, launch, maintain, and store boats. We also set docks and moorings. Over the year, I learned and practiced a wide variety of skills. 
  <ul> 
    <li>Sanding, varnishing, painting, polishing, waxing </li>
    <li>Operating the fork truck, tractor, and hydraulic trailer to pick up and move boats </li>
    <li>Maneuvering/towing boats in the water for delivery</li>
    <li>Using a bosun's chair to make repairs to masts</li> 
    <li>Splicing rope</li>
    <li>Stepping masts and rigging sails</li>
    <li>Communicating effectively with customers</li>
    </ul>
