Maine is a fantastic place to live when you have a passion for the outdoors. I love to hike, bike, camp, ski, and wakeboard. I’ve spent a lot of time hiking and biking in Acadia National Park, which is just across Frenchman’s Bay from where I live. It's beautiful in Acadia, and I've always counted myself as lucky for getting to spend so much of my childhood there.

  As long as I can remember, I’ve loved bicycles. As a kid back in New Hampshire, I was out pedaling around constantly. It wasn’t long before I craved getting airborne on my bike, and I made a crude jump at the bottom of the hill in our backyard. Excited to document my newest venture, I asked my dad to film the first flight.

   This evolved into four wheelers and then dirt bikes.  Everyone should get the chance to gracefully carve through the turns of a forest trail on a dirt bike. It requires you to bring together your body and your bike together as a single unit and once you figure this out, it's a great experience. Another aspect of dirt biking I like is the need to be self sufficient. When your bike breaks down many miles away from civilization (and it will breakdown!) you have to figure it out on your own.
