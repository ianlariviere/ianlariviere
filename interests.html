Maine is a fantastic place to live when you have a passion for the outdoors. I love to hike, bike, camp, ski, and wakeboard. I’ve spent a lot of time hiking and biking in Acadia National Park, which is just across Frenchman’s Bay from where I live. It's beautiful in Acadia, and I've always counted myself as lucky for getting to spend so much of my childhood there.

  As long as I can remember, I’ve loved bicycles. As a kid back in New Hampshire, I was out pedaling around constantly. It wasn’t long before I craved getting airborne on my bike, and I made a crude jump at the bottom of the hill in our backyard. Excited to document my newest venture, I asked my dad to film the first flight.
